Using the supplied remote control with the GoGo Board is simple. With the GoGo Widget software running, just point the remote towards the GoGo Board and press any button. You should see a number code appear under the remote icon. Each button will have a unique number code. For example, the number 1 normally has a number code = 128. This code can be later used in your program to perform desired actions.

**Setup**: If your GoGo kit comes with a universal remote, you must configure it before use. The GoGo Board works with Sony remotes. Consult your remote’s manual for detailed instructions on how to control Sony devices.

## Tips:

* Infrared remotes often do not require direct line-of-sight to work. The signal can bounce off walls and penetrate sheets of paper.
* The “power” button will function the same way as the “run” button on the GoGo Board. Use this button to run or stop a program on the GoGo Board.
* Holding down a button on the remote usually causes repetitive pulses. This may cause the GoGo Board to receive the same command more than once. Some remotes sends out three pulses even with a quick press. You may have to take this into account when writing your program.
