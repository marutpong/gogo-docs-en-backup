* The power and direction can be individually selected for each port
* Each port has LEDs that indicate the on/off status. The LED color indicates the direction
* Power adjustment is available from 0 \(lowest, equivalent to “off”\) to 100 \(highest\)
* Each port can drive 3-12v motors with current under 500mA per port.
* The port automatically shuts-off if overheated.
