# 4.1 Motor Types

Two kinds of motors can be used with the GoGo Board: DC and servo. DC motors are the simplest kind. Once powered, DC motors rotate indefinitely. Servo motors are not usually used for rotation, but more to point at a given angle. More information can be found on Wikipediaâ€™s article on [DC motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_motor) and [servo motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomotor).

## DC and Servo Motor Connectors {#dc-and-servo-motor-connectors}

DC motors use the white 2-pin JST connectors while servo motors use the 3-pin male connectors. Each port can control only one type of motor at a time. That is, you cannot connect both a DC and a servo motor to the same port. For example, you cannot use DC-A and Servo-A at the same time. But using DC-A and Servo-B is fine.

## Choosing the Motor Mode {#choosing-the-motor-mode}

All four output ports can be independently programmed \(in Logo/Tinker\) to control DC or servo motors. However, the GoGo Widget can control only one type at a time. To perform an operation, select the desired motor ports and then click on the motor type icon as shown above. The available operations will then be shown.
