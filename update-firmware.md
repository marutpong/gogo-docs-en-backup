# 8 - Updating your Firmware

Because the GoGo Board is constantly improved, make sure to upgrade the board’s firmware to the latest version. You can download the latest firmware from GoGo Board website.

## Using the GoGo Widget to Update the Firmware {#using-the-gogo-widget-to-update-the-firmware}

A firmware is a file with a .HEX extension. Once you have downloaded a new firmware and saved it to your computer, launch the GoGo Widget and click on the “Configurations” tab. There you will see a section on the screen that tells you what firmware version is running on the GoGo Board. Click on the “Update from file” button and select the new firmware HEX file. The update will take place automatically. The LED on the GoGo Board will rapidly blink during this process. Once the update is done, a new version number should be seen on the screen.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Caution** - Do not interrupt the firmware update process! Once the process starts, wait until it is done. The update can take up to 1 minute. The GoGo Widget may appear to be unresponsive, but the update process is still going on. Any interruption can corrupt the firmware and render the GoGo Board unusable. The only way to fix a corrupted firmware is to re-flash the processor using a flashing tool.
